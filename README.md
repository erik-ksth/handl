## 💡 Why Handl Exists

The idea for Handl came from a real problem: finding a repair shop for a broken laptop screen. Comparing prices meant calling dozens of shops, asking the same questions, and negotiating. It was tedious and mentally draining.

Handl was built to remove that friction. **Phone calls are still necessary — but humans shouldn't have to make all of them.**
